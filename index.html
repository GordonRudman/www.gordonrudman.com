The more complex and tricky the task or project at hand, the more Gordon excels.

This combination of big-picture, critical and innovative thinking is what marks Gordon out. He is someone who you can trust to get the right thing done, and to get it done right.</p>

I was the first to be hired, as Senior Software Engineer, under his management at the time and we kept like that for a couple of months until other members joined the team. Those initial months, having Gordon’s dedicated time was good as he clarified my initial doubts and proper presented me with the plan the company had for the following Quarters. During the time I worked with Gordon, I realized that he has a vary of strong skills, from defining software architecture to managing and mentoring people. Nowadays I realized I had a different level of professionalism, I wasn’t mature as I am now as a Software Engineer and I thank you Gordon for this. I took Gordon as my mentor and while working with him I have learned very important lessons in how to deal in certain situations, deal with people and their skills and how to always try to be my best, not only in the technical level but as a person and professional in general. At the time I worked with Gordon, we defined a Microservice Architecture using Event-Sourcing and CQRS to implement an e-commerce application, it was in a fast pace Agile development environment where he drove and mentored us to drive design meetings, sprint reviews, product presentations also manage POs and PMs expectations. He showed to be worried about our career goals and directions and he was always trying to help us, at his best, to achieve our goals. I am sure he will be an outstanding addition to any team and I would definitely work with him again.</p>

                      <p class="clear-margin">It&#x27;s not very often that you get to work with a professional with a ridiculously high level attention and effectiveness when it comes to manage development operations and documentation; When working on QA Automation it is vital to get as much information and in as straightforward as possible fashion from the dev teams, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got, faultlessly, any time I interacted with teams managed by Gordon. Working for Asavie Technologies Ltd. in Dublin, I had the pleasure to collaborate with Gordon on a number of projects including e-Commerce and &#x27;Internet of Things&#x27; platform development; I am not exaggerating when I say his attention and efficiency made my job way easier than it could have been providing clear and well organized code, linear and understandable requirements and documentation and open, flowing collaboration. This made writing automated test cases for projects whose development was managed by Gordon as smooth as a process as it can be. His technical knowledge as well as his development process organization skills also proved very important in a cross-team scenario, where Gordon greatly helped researching and spearheading the adoption of a number of workflow improvements - from a bug reporting system to automated cloud deployment on Microsoft Azure. Equally impressive is his grasp on &#x27;real world scenarios&#x27;, which helped to preemptively avoid some issues that could, in time, have turned fairly problematic. As a development manager and colleague, Gordon earns my highest recommendation.</p>
